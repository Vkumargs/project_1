::::::::::::::::::::  DAY1 of Random coding ::::::::::::::

1. When you use macro definition for defining integer, the macro doesn't contain the data type
2. got frustrated to compile each file through console, so choose to use CMakeLists
3. Again using cmake commands for building and compiling again and again is hectic, so used .bat script for build and run

1. Was excited to use the github.
2. Linked the local repository with the remote repositiory and pushed the code to the main remote repository
